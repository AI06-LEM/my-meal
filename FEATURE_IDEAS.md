# Ideas for potential future features

 - Multiple meals per day
 - Allow for different language (fr, en, de)
 - Tutorial showing how to use the software
 - Ask Seefood: option for two fish or two meat options per week?

### Archiving
- After the restaurant confirms the weekly meal plan, the system admin must click on a new button 'Start New Week' which:
  - Archives current week's data
  - Clears all guest votes (background data) and vote charts (admin/restaurant)
  - Clears weekly options (guest page)
  - Displays the meal plan selected by the restaurant on the guest page
- The software keeps a memory of the last three weeks of meal plans, and no meal repeats within two weeks
